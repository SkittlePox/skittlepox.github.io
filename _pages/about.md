Hi! I'm Ben, a third-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Brown University advised by [George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/). My research focuses on the **language grounding problem**, drawing inspiration from linguistics, cognitive science, philosophy of mind/language, and semiotics.

I'm honored to be a recipient of the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2022/05/20/five-brown-cs-students-and-alums-receive-nsf-graduate-research-fellowships/) and the Brown University [Morgan Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Edwards) Fellowship. In 2023, I had the privilege of serving as the lead organizer for the [Brown Robotics Talk Series](https://yzylmc.github.io/brown-lab-talks/). I was also a founding member of the [Brown AI Safety Team](https://www.baist.ai/).

### Research Philosophy

Human perception and action systems induce a rich and highly structured decision process â€” **natural language serves as a medium to express information about this decision process**. My earlier works build toward highly engineered solutions to the **language grounding** problem using a [formal language for describing Markov Decision Processes](http://rlang.ai/master/) as a semantic representation, my newer work leverages multi-agent RL to generate synthetic languages about decision processes.

I maintain a (not always up to date) record of my academic readings, with [papers cataloged here](https://www.zotero.org/benjamin-spiegel/library) and [books listed here](https://speeg.notion.site/5de77c8575634b90b4699d0f185295cb?v=a884d376bf6b4e5a99a27e9aa2e98698&pvs=4).

### Personal Interests

I enjoy reading, watching movies, playing ultimate frisbee, playing piano, listening to music, and solving Rubik's Cubes (my personal best for a 3-by-3 is 9.58s, and my best Ao5 was ~12s). I also practice mindfulness meditation and was briefly [a frequenter of LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/benjamin-spiegel).
